aspect ratio plasmonic particle_, SIAM Multiscale Modeling & Simulation (2021). [Submited]

The bibtex entry can be access by the command.

```bash
python3 -c "from src import __bibtex__; print(__bibtex__)"
```

## Requirements

- Python version:

  - Tested on Python 3.9;
  - Should works on Python â‰¥3.7 but not tested.

- Require the following libraries:

  - For numerical computations: [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) and [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy);

  - For symbolic computations: [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy);

  - For visualization: [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) and [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn);

  - For Jupyter notebook: [IPython](https://github.com/ipython/ipython) and [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab).

Might works with previous versions of the libraries but if it does not works try to update the libraries for example through pip

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

and for the dev dependencies

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Install

Clone from GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zmoitier/Scattering_BIE_QPAX.git
```

## Instructions for usage

Run the Jupyter notebook `notebook_article/run_fig_n.ipynb` to get the corresponding figure `n` in the article and run the Jupyter notebook `notebook_proceeding/run_fig_n.ipynb` to get the corresponding figure `n` in the proceeding.

## Symbolic expressions

The Symbolic_expansions folder provides inner expansions for Laplace and Helmholtz double-layer potentials using Mathematica notebook or SymPy (see section 3 and 4 or the associated manuscript).
